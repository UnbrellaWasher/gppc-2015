Please download map-read-only/ and scenario-read-only/ from the GPPC and place it in the same directory as this README from http://movingai.com/GPPC/path.zip

To compile Speedy, w1_1, w4, w5, use:

make -C gppc-2015-submission/Speedy/

or use make.sh

NOTE: For better performance please add "-O3" to the Makefile of these directories

makeRabinAStarEntry - script to compile Rabin A* without bucketlist

makeRabinAStarBucketEntry - script to compile Rabin A* with bucketlist

For speedy.sh, w1.sh, w4.sh, w5.sh, and rabin.sh, use the following usage:

[...].sh map_folder_name map_name

e.g. ./speedy.sh wc3maps512 moonglade.map_folder_name

results.py - python script to spawn scripts for Speedy, w1_1, w4, w5, and rabin A* on a given map instance

Pass results.py the same arguments to get the averages from each map instance.

all.sh - script used by results.py to spawn all scripts 

This is used by results.py to run each algorithm on the map, and then results.py will take the average and output it.

wc3maps512.sh, sc1.sh, dao.sh, random.sh - these all spawn results.py for each instance in the respective map folder

configure.sh - creates the directories speedy, w1_1, w4, w5, and rabinastar
